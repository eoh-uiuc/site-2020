            We regret to inform you that EOH 100 will no longer be happening as planned. Unfortunately, 
            EOH will not be allowed to take place due to the COVID-19 virus. We realize this is incredibly 
            disappointing for all parties involved, exhibitors, sponsors, the committee, and the visitors as well as the college. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In an effort to still interact with the EOH community despite the cancellation, 
            we will be uploading videos explaining STEM activities that you can safely do at home. Check out "EOH Comes to You" for more! 
            Thank you for your support and commitment to our event.
