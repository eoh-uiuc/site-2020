            We regret to inform you that EOH 100 will no longer be happening as planned. Unfortunately, 
            EOH will not be allowed to take place due to the COVID-19 virus. We realize this is incredibly 
            disappointing for all parties involved, exhibitors, sponsors, the committee, and the visitors as well as the college. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Thank you for your commitment to our event, and we apologize for any inconvenience.  
        </p>
