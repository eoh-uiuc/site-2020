        The Startup Showcase is a third-year exhibit that presents startup companies in the
        Champaign-Urbana area flourishing from the engineering and business programs here
        at the University of Illinois. These are groups that have spent countless hours
        developing their own ideas into a product and furthermore into a company. They will
        be demonstrating their unique ideas and showing how they are working towards a
        better and brighter future.
