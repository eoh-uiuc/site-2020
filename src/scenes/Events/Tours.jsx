        The general tours will highlight our most popular attractions and walk the
        group around various engineering campus buildings. The tours are approximately
        one hour and cover everything from UofI history to EOH exhibit locations. This
        tour leaves every half hour from the Bardeen Quad Visitor Information stand and
        prior registration is not required. We recommend this tour for first time UofI
        and EOH visitors.
